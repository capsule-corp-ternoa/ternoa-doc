# Getting Started

___

## Installation ⌨️

We recommend installing ternoa-js in your project with Node.js using npm: 

`npm install ternoa-js`

And there you go! You're ready to use the latest stable version of the Ternoa-js SDK.

## Fancy trying the upcoming features? 

If you rather go with one of the most advanced versions of the SDK, you can download either a **@beta** or the next **release candidate @rc** version. This version contains some fixes to come, but some features that are not stable yet: @beta version is an internal and public testing environment. Even though @rc versions are unstable, they tend to be the closest ones to the production version.

You can check the versions available directly on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ternoa-js) and choose the one you need.  **Take a look at the changelog** to know what we are cooking in each of them before installing: 

Example to specify a version: `npm i ternoa-js@1.2.0-rc0`

## Let's get started!

Now the SDK is installed, you are ready to go. The following section will cover the basic SDK workflow to init the api and start the transaction process.
