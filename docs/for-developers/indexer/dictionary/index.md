# Overview

If you already looked at our documentation, you should now [understand](/ternoa-fundamentals/offchain-components/builder-tools/dictionary) that the indexing datas provided by the chain can be retrieved both on our (**[alphanet indexer](https://indexer-alphanet.ternoa.dev/)** or **[mainnet indexer](https://indexer-mainnet.ternoa.network/)**), but also on our [dictionary](https://dictionary-mainnet.ternoa.dev/). 

Since the [Dictionary](/for-developers/#what-are-the-differences-between-the-dictionary-or-the-indexer) is focused on native substrate on-chain data contained in **blocks**, (instead of being focused on listening events like the indexer), you can use it for : 
- [Installing](/for-developers/indexer/dictionary/use-dictionary) it into your own indexer as we do to improve performance.
- Use it as an to [query datas](http://localhost:3000/for-developers/indexer/dictionary/use-dictionnary-explorer) exactly like on the indexer

_If you want to know which tool suits you the best, look at the official [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/academy/tutorials_examples/dictionary.html)._
