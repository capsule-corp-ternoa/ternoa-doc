# Dictionary

Ternoa Dictionary records all the native substrate on-chain data of the Ternoa blockchain: blocks, extrinsics, and events. It is a glossary of data that pre-indexes chain events, drastically improving the overall indexing performance. Unlike the Indexer, no data relating to the Ternoa pallets is covered by the Dictionary.

Ternoa deploys its own indexer [here](https://dictionary-mainnet.ternoa.dev/) on which you can submit GraphQL queries to retrieve on-chain data.
For more information on how to run your own Dictionary go to the [developers section](/category/dictionary).
