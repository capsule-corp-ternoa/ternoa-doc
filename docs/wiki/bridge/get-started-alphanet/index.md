**How to bridge test CAPS on Ternoa & Ethereum**

Before using the **[Token Bridge](https://alphanet.bridge.ternoa.network/)** on Alphanet, you will need to first get your Ternoa account imported in Polkadot{.js}. Once it's added to the Polkadot extension, you can claim Ternoa test CAPS and ETH test tokens. 


## First, get your Ternoa account on Polkadot{.js}

In order to interact with your Ternoa Wallet from your browser to any dApp, you need to get your Ternoa account imported in Polkadot{.js} **[browser extension.](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)**

Download the extension: **https://polkadot.js.org/extension/**

:::caution
The Polkadot{.js} extension is not compatible on a mobile browser. To connect your wallet to the extension, you will need to be on a desktop browser. 
:::

Once installed, you can either import account from pre-existing seed from your Ternoa Wallet or connect your Substrate address from a hardware wallet.

If you have a Ternoa Wallet account, you can import your wallet directly on the extension. **It will be necessary to have your wallet connected to validate transactions.**
