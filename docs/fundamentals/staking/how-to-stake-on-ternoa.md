# How to Stake in Ternoa

> Nominating validators and staking CAPS

**You can nominate validators (also known as “staking”) on Polkadot-JS UI using these steps:**

2. **Switch to Ternoa Network** : 
  + **Open the network** list by clicking on the down arrow in the top menu

## You are now connected to to the Ternoa network and can start staking CAPS following those steps:

<br/>

1. **[ Create a Polkadot account](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-generation)** if you don’t have one already

:::info
Please note **it is recommended to create two accounts**: one to use as the controller account and one to use as your stash account. Learn more about this **[here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking)** and in the video tutorial below. 
:::

:::caution
**Make sure you leave a small amount of CAPS transferrable in your stash account and that your controller has more than 1 CAPS in it.** This is in order to have enough liquid funds for paying transaction fees when bonding and unbonding funds.

3. Under the Network tab at the top click the **Staking** option
