# Governance

CAPS is the native token of the Ternoa network/ecosystem and it plays a central role in the Blockchain's Governance.

The administration of Stakeholder vote is managed by the Democracy module. 
It allows CAPS holders to have proportional voting power and a say in the decision making process regarding blockchain governance which includes developments, protocols, etc.

For a proposal to be (integrated?), it first has to be voted on for which it has to be added to either one the two queues accordingly : 

* The `Proposal Queue` : which comprises of all public proposals
* The `External Queue` : which comprises of a single proposal of external origin. (like a Technical committee or a collective group)


At the launch period, a referendum is created from a proposal taken from either one of the queues. {accoding to the conditions set beforehand }(wasn't it supposed to be the most popular ones?)

Any CAPS holder in the system can vote on referendums. The voting system allows the holder to fix their conviction behind the vote. The conviction dictates the token lockup period as well as the multiplier which scales the power of the vote exponentially.
