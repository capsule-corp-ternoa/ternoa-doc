# ðŸ“ˆ Auctions

## ðŸ’¡ What is an Auction ? 
Auctions can be an exciting way to sell an NFT. An auction is a type of sale where the NFT seller sets a minimum price and a time period. Buyers can place bids on the amount they are willing to pay for the NFT as long as they are above the minimum price. At the end of the time period, the NFT is sold to the highest bidder.

## Abstract
In the objective of giving different ways to sell an NFT, auctions could be a great way to hype the project or an NFT.  **Auctions are a type of sale where the NFT seller sets a minimum price they are willing to sell their NFT and by defining the time duration**. Buyers can place bids with the amount they are willing to pay for the NFT as long as it is above the minimum price. At the end of the time period, the NFT is sold to the highest bidder. 

## Motivation
The main objective of auctions is to give sellers flexibility to sell their NFTs online. On the other hand the auctions can help maximize the value of NFTs as a subsequent bid will always be higher than the preceeding bid. Plus, this could be a mechanism for a project to discover price by auctioning the genesis collection rather than simply selling it.

And for users, who see adherence to a decentralized and disintermediated process as essential to the basic concept of blockchain, the only legitimate auction process for NFTs is on-chain. Conducting auctions on-chain lends the bidding process many of the benefits typically associated with blockchain-based transactions. **For instance, auctions conducted on a blockchain are auditable: every bid is public and permanently recorded, which makes bids more secure and transparent.**

## âœ¨ How does English auction work?

:::info
**English Auction or Highest bid (where the highest bid wins at the end)**
The bidding starts with the starting price which is set by the seller of the NFT and increases with the continuous bidding from the different buyers until the price is reached at Buy it now price.

Under this auction process, only one quantity of an NFT will be listed for sale.
:::

The seller can choose to accept it at any time, but the buyer will need CAPS to create a bid.

**Before we look at the working, there are some terms to understand:**

| **Terms**    | **Explanations** 
| ----------- | ----------- 
| **Starting Price**    | A starting price of an auction is the lowest possible bid that the first bidder may place. A seller is willing to accept at least the Starting Price. 
| **Duration**   | Range of days, weeks or months for which an auction will run and at the end of this range the auction/bidding process will close automatically.  
| **Buy it Now Price** | Users will have an option to add a Buy It Now option to their auction listings, buyers can either purchase the NFT right away at the Buy It Now price or place a bid.  
| **Royalties**   | <ul><li>One of the unique features of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is the ability to earn royalties from resales.</li><li>NFTs can be programmed so that each transaction includes royalties, allowing creators to be rewarded fairly for their work. The fact that NFTs are created and stored on the blockchain, means they can be traded seamlessly from wallet to wallet, with royalties paid every time they move.</li></ul><ul>The next Bid should be higher than the current highest bid:<li>Bid Offer = CAPS</li><li>Bid Offer = CAPS</li><li>The Bid includes the bid offer + Transaction fee</li><li>Userâ€™s CAPS will be locked as soon as a bid is placed in escrow account</li><li>In case of subsequent bids, all the previous bids will be locked until users increase their bids. If the users choose not to increase their bid, the bid offer will be released and sent back to their Wallet. This also means that the bid was cancelled.</li><li>In case a bid is cancelled the bid offer will be returned to the userâ€™s wallet</li><li>Once the seller accepts the bid the bid offer will be transferred to their account automatically</li></ul>
