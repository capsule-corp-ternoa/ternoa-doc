# üß© E2E test dApp

**The E2E test dApp is the easiest way to test our SDK.** 


## Ternoa-js SDK ‚öôÔ∏è 

>**[Ternoa-js SDK](https://github.com/capsule-corp-ternoa/ternoa-js)** has been thought with one intention: **it aims to be one of the easiest tool to build web3 projects on top of the Ternoa Chain**. 


Based on **Polkadot.js API** and **Javascript**, it offers application developers the ability to query substrate chains like the Ternoa chain. It provides a seamless experience and allows you to start building at a glance : an extra short init and just a few lines of code after, you will create your NFT.

You can submit any transaction to the chain to manage your NFTs or familiarize yourself with our helpers with the code snippets.
This application aims to be build by the community and is **the perfect entry door to learn how to use Ternoa SDK**, your contribution and interest are warm welcomed.

## Getting Started the Ternoa JS Test Dapp
### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```bash
npm install ternoa-js
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** with your browser to see the result.

### Code Style

This project uses recommended ESLint and Typescript rules to ensure coding good practices.

We've setup linters and formatters to help catch errors and improve the development experience:

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** ‚Äì ensures that code is formatted in a readable way.
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** ‚Äî checks code for antipatterns as well as formatting.

**[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)** proceeds some checks before pushing a new commit. It ensures that: the project is building, there are no linter/formatting issues and the test suites are not broken.

> If you use Visual Studio Code editor we suggest you to install **[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)** and **[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)** extensions.

## App Worklow üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The **[Helpers](https://e2e.ternoa.network/app/NFT/CreateNFT)** section list several helpers from our SDK and their parameters presented in a form. The request is created once the required fields are correctly filled in. It has to be signed before being submited to the chain. You can connect your Ternoa Wallet with Wallet Connect or use your Polkadot extension.

Ternoa ecosystem is based on 2 environments: **Alphanet** & **Mainnet**, where transactions are conducted in **$CAPS token**.
- **Alphanet** stands for the gateway to explore and test the Ternoa chain. It uses test $CAPS tokens claimable on our faucet: **[Alphanet Faucet](https://www.ternoa.com/alphanet)**.
- **Mainnet** is the main chain where data is stored.

:::tip

**By default** the dApp is connected to the Alphanet chain. 
You can swith to Mainnet by clicking on the pill located on the top right corner.
