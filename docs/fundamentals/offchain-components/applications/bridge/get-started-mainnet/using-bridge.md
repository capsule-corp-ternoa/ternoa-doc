# Using Bridge

## It's time to go to the [Token Bridge](https://bridge.ternoa.network/)!

The bridge is extremely easy to use and intuitive, so all the magic happens on the backstage. But let's go through the basic steps to start bridging your CAPS.

**The way the Bridge works is very simple.**

1. Connect your wallet to **Polkadot{JS}** and/or **MetaMask**
2. Select the **'From'** and **'To'** network
3. Enter the amount of CAPS to bridge
- Note: the minimum is 200 CAPS and the maximum is 200,000 CAPS
4. Approve the contract (only once)
5. Approve the transaction
6.Wait...and your CAPS will arrive at the selected destination.

:::caution
The Bridge has quantum limitations to reduce network congestion. Therefore, we offer OTC Bridge services for all transfers between Ethereum and Ternoa chain over 1M CAPS. To place a request for an OTC transfer, please contact our support team: otcbridge@ternoa.network
