# 👋 Welcome  

**Welcome to Ternoa Docs, the hub for those interested in learning, building, or maintaining the Ternoa ecosystem. This documentation will provide you with everything you need to get started with Ternoa as a user or developer.**

## What is Ternoa?

> [Ternoa](https://www.ternoa.network/) is an open-source substrate-based layer 1 blockchain, designed for mass adoption of Utility NFTs.
> 
>Ternoa designs an infrastructure to accelerate web3 development by making next-generation utility NFTs easy to build on our blockchain. The Ternoa ecosystem facilitates the adoption of utility NFTs by giving developers a full technological stack and access to independent infrastructure, nodes, developer communities, and funding. Our Utility NFTs include:
>
-   Delegation
-   Renting
-   SoulBound
-   Royalties
-   Auctions
-   Secret (coming soon)
-   Capsules (coming soon)
>
> Creating NFTs and building dApps on most blockchains is complex. Ternoa was designed to break barriers for developers, web3 enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs and empower them to save time and money. We believe mass adoption of NFTs is only possible with a fundamental tech evolution. In this guide, we have developed a range of tools to walk you through how to use and build on Ternoa for the first time.
