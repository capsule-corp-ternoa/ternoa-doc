# 🤝 Contributing

Nonetheless, pull requests, discussions, and contributions from the community are encouraged.

Otherwise, Capsule Corp Labs holds the administrative position and final word on the content that is included. 
Specifically, the Technical Education team at the Labs are most directly involved.


## 📚 How to Contribute

You can contribute to the wiki on the [capsule-corp-ternoa/ternoa-doc](https://github.com/capsule-corp-ternoa/ternoa-doc) GitHub repository. 
Every page is a [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file, which is an easy to learn syntax extension to plain text that makes creating links, rendering images, and nice-looking formatting simple.

Each page has an "Edit this file" ✏️ button at the top right of the content.

If you're logged in, you'll be taken to the GitHub built-in text editor where you can make your edits directly on the file. 
When you've completed your changes, you can add any specific details on what was changed and commit to a new branch to create a new Pull Request to the repository. 

From there one of the Ternoa team member will review your changes, and either merge them or request changes with comment.
